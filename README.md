# Hackfest 2016 - Phenix

## Context

Credentials were given to connect to a virtual machine on which resided multiple executables to reverse engineer.

There were basically two categories :
* Static binary analysis
* Dynamic malware analysis and removal

### Static Binary analysis

The executables in [Golgoth/](Golgoth/) and [Anterak/](Anterak/) were to be reverse engineered to find the secret password or serial key.
By entering the right input into the program, you were given a flag which was rewarded with points in the competition.

### Dynamic Malware Analysis

Multiple malwares were running on the provided virtual machine.
The executable to validate that the malwares were removed is in [Malware/](Malware/).
Can you find the flags without the virtual machine?
